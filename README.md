# Random Badminton Grip Type Generator üè∏
Generates a badminton grip randomly, you have to switch to that grip. 
## Welcome, Shuttlers!
- Have fun with our app that randomly selects one of the four badminton grips and reads them aloud, with a bias towards "Forehand"!
- Designed to help you create a habit of switching between the four basic badminton grips. 

## Features at a Glance
- Randomly shouts out one of the four badminton grips: "Forehand", "Backhand", "Bevel", and "Panhandle"
- Loves "Forehand" a bit extra (because we use it more often in real life too)
- Surprises you with grips every 0.8 to 2.5 seconds
- Simple Start/Stop buttons - sleek and easy
- Minimalist design

## Quick Start
Grab a racket, open `index.html` in a browser, click "Start," and switch to the grip it asks you to.

Have fun!
